# GRIP OR SLIP
This is a little game made by two second year students of the Videogame Design and Development degree. It's a platformer with two levels where the player must jump, grip to the metal nets and kill the enemies to complete the game. It has been made using C++, SDL and pugi libraries. The maps have been made using Tiled.
